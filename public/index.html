            In adult adjunctive therapy placebo-controlled clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (at least 5% for BRIVIACT and at least 2% more freuqently than placebo) were somnolonce and sedation, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea and vomiting symptoms. Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies of pediatric patients 4 years to less than 16 years of age were generally similar to those in adult patients. 
            Adverse reactions with BRIVIACT injection in adult patients are generally similar to those observed with BRIVIACT tablets and also include dysgeusia, euphoric mood, feeling drunk, and infusion site pain. The safety of BRIVIACT injection in pediatric patients has not been established.

    <h2>Important safety information</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Suicidal Behavior and Ideation:</b>Antieptic drugs, incuding BRIVIACT, increase the risk of suicidal behavior and ideation. Monitor patients taking BRIVIACT for the emergence or worsening of depression; unusual changes in mood or behavior; or suicidal thought, behavior, or self-harm. Advise patients, their caregivers, and/or families to be alert for these behavioral changes and report them immediately to a provider.
        </li> <br>
        <li><b>Neurological Adverse Reactions:</b> causes somnolence, fatigue, dizziness, and disturbance in coordination. Somnolence and fatigue-related adverse reaction were reported in 25% of adult patients taking at least 50 mg per day of BRIVIACT compared to 14% of adult patients taking placebo. Dizziness and disturbance in gait and coordination were reported in 16% of adult patients taking at least 50 mg per day of BRIVIACT compared to 10% of adult patients taking placebo. The risks is greatest early in treatment but can occur at any time. Monitor patients for these signs any symptoms and advise them not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on BRIVIACT.</li>
        <li><b>Physhiatric Adverse Reactions:</b>BRIVIACT causes physhiatric adverse reactions, including non-physhotic and psychotic symptoms. These events were reported in approximately 13% of adult patients taking at least 50 mg per day of BRIVIACT compared to 8% of adult patients taking placebo. A total 0f 1.7% of adult patients taking BRIVIACT discontinued treatment due to psychiatric reactions compared to 1.3% of patients taking placebo. Phychiatric adverse reactions were also observed in open-label pediatric trials and were generally similar to those observed in adults. Advise patients to report these symptoms immediately to a healthcare provider.</li>
        <li><b>Hypersensitivity:</b>BRIVIACT can cause hypersensitivity reactions. Bronhospasm and angioedema have been reported. Discontinue BRIVIACT if a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction after treatment. BRIVIACT is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to brivacetam or any of the inactive ingredients.</li>
        <li><b>Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs:</b>As with all antiepileptic drugs, BRIVIACT should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="subtitle">DOSING CONSIDERATIONS</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with all stages of hepatic impairment.</li>
        <li>When BRIVIACT is co-administered with rifampin, an increase in tre BRIVIACT dose is recommended.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="subtitle">ADVERSE REACTIONS</p>
    <p class="briviact">In adult adjunctive therapy placebo-controlled clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (at least 5% for BRIVIACT and at least 2% more frequently than placebo) were somnolence and sedation, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea and vomiting symptoms.
